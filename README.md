# IRCgen2-Specs
Specs for second generation of IRC

# What is IRCgen2?
IRCgen2 is a rewrite of IRC. Currently, IRC is a bunch of RFC's defining specs that are not fully implmented by many clients and servers. IRCgen2 is designed to clean up that mess by combining all of the features that are commonly used into one specfication.
